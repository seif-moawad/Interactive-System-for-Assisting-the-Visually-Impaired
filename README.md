# Interactive System for Assisting the Visually Impaired

Welcome to the Interactive System for Assisting the Visually Impaired! This innovative system utilizes advanced technology to provide assistance and enhance the daily lives of individuals with visual impairments. By combining a camera, speech synthesis, eye gaze tracking, object detection, facial recognition, and emotion detection, this system aims to improve accessibility and independence for the visually impaired. Read on to learn more about the key components and functionalities of this interactive system.

## Components

### Camera
The camera integrated into the system serves multiple purposes. It detects objects and individuals within its field of view, enabling the system to provide valuable information about the surroundings. Additionally, it tracks the eye gaze of the person in front of it, allowing for interactive engagement and notifications.

### Object Detection and Speech Synthesis
The object detection component of the system identifies and recognizes various objects within the camera's range. When an object is detected, the system generates synthesized speech that announces the name of the object, helping the user understand their environment more effectively.

### Eye Gaze Tracking and Notification
The system employs eye gaze tracking technology to determine if the user is looking directly at the camera. When the eye gaze is centered, the system provides an audio notification, such as "Someone is looking at you." This feature promotes social interaction by alerting the visually impaired individual to the presence of others.

### Red Ball Detection
The system has a unique feature that recognizes the presence of a red ball on the screen. When a red ball is detected, it triggers the opening of a specific application or performs a predefined action, providing additional functionality and convenience to the user.

### Time Announcement with Laser Tracking
Using laser tracking technology, the system can determine the current time. When the laser is tracked, the system synthesizes speech to announce the current time, assisting the visually impaired in accessing this important information.

### Facial Recognition and Database Integration
The camera's facial recognition component identifies faces within its field of view. It compares the detected faces against a preloaded database of known individuals. If a match is found, the system announces the person's name. For unrecognized faces, the system generates a message saying "Unknown" and may provide additional information such as approximate age and emotions detected on the face.
